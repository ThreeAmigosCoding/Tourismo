## About
This repository contains the implementation of a travel agent application Tourismo designed to support travel arrangements in Serbia. The application allows registration of clients who wish to use the agent's services for traveling within Serbia. The primary users of the application are independent travel agents who organize trips within Serbia.

## Features
- Booking and purchasing trips: Registered users can browse available trips and make reservations or purchase them.
- Viewing purchased and reserved trips: Users can view their purchased and reserved trips.
- Browsing all trips: Users can browse all available trips.
- Map view of trips: Trips can be viewed on a map for better visualization.
- Adding, modifying, and deleting trips: Agents can add, modify, and delete trips.
- Adding, modifying, and deleting tourist attractions: Agents can manage tourist attractions associated with trips.
- Adding, modifying, and deleting accommodations and restaurants: Agents can manage accommodations and restaurants linked to trips.
- Viewing sold trips within a specific month: Agents can track the number of trips sold in a given month.
- Viewing sold packages for a specific trip: Agents can view the number of sold arrangements for a particular trip.

## Documentation
The application includes online documentation integrated within the interface. The documentation covers each context where it can be accessed and provides contextual help.

## User Profiles and Usage Scenario
The application caters to two types of users:

- Registered Users (Clients/Travelers): These users can browse available trips and make reservations or purchases.
- Agents: Agents have additional functionalities and can add, modify, and delete trips, tourist attractions, accommodations, and restaurants.

The application is adapted to the following user profile and usage scenario

User Profile:
- Gender: Female
- Age: 41 years
- Domain Knowledge: Moderate. Familiar with basic terminology related to the application's domain.
- Computer Literacy: Extremely high. Experienced in computer usage, potentially possessing advanced knowledge.
- Constraints: Operates in a highly distracted and time-limited environment, requiring speed, shortcuts, and automation.

Usage Scenario: 
This scenario represents a situation where entering incorrect data can potentially have severe consequences. Therefore, the interface is designed to be highly resilient to incorrect data entry and provides efficient and detailed errors reporting for input validation.
