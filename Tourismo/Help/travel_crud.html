                <div class="img-div"><img src="Images/travel_crud2.png" alt="nothing"></div>
                <p>The window features three list views: "All Attractions," "Default Attractions," and "Additional Attractions."

                <h3>Managing Attractions</h3>

                <p>
                <strong>1. All Attractions:</strong> This is the main list view that displays all the tourist attractions available in the system. You can browse through the list to find attractions that interest you. The search bar located at the top of this list view allows you to search for attractions by their names. Simply enter your search query and the list will update in real-time to display the matching attractions.
                </p>

                <p>
                <strong>2. Default Attractions:</strong> This list view contains the attractions that are automatically included in a new travel itinerary. You can drag attractions from the "All Attractions" list view and drop them into this list to add them to your travel plan. To remove an attraction from the default list, simply drag it back to the "All Attractions" list view.
                </p>

                <p>
                <strong>3. Additional Attractions:</strong> This list view is meant for attractions that you want to add to your travel itinerary beyond the default ones. Similarly to the "Default Attractions" list view, you can drag attractions from the "All Attractions" list view and drop them into this list to include them in your travel plan. If you decide to remove an attraction from the additional list, drag it back to the "All Attractions" list view.
